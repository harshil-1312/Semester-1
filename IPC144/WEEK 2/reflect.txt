The cent2 variable doesn’t work properly just because in the double, long double and float we didn’t get the precise answer because it always appears in the pairs and also  follows the base function and celling function just like if the output is 10.266 then as per the celling function if the variable is more than 5 than it roundup so final output is 10.27 .And  like in the base function if the output is 10.24 or variable is less than 5 than the final output change to  10.2399. That are the reason why it can not be use in business and the managements because it always shows the floating answer and we didn’t get the precise answer.2.              #include <stdio.h>		int main()		{   		 int x; 		 printf ("Enter the value of x: ");    		 scanf ("%d", &x);           		 int modFifty = x % 50;    		 int modTwenty = modFifty % 20;		 int modTen = modTwenty % 10;		 int modFive = modTen % 5;                		 int divFifty = x / 50;    		 int divTwenty = modFifty / 20;    		 int divTen = modTwenty / 10;    		 int divFive = modTen / 5;printf ("Fifties: %d \nTwenties: %d \nTens: %d \nFives: %d",divFifty, divTwenty, divTen, divFive);   		 return 0;		 }3.      #include <stdio.h>      	int main()        {        int x=19,y=4;     	 float a;     	 a = (float)x / (float)y;     	 printf("First : %f\n",a);     	 printf("Second : %0.4lf\n",a);      	 printf("Third : %0.4f",a);      	 return 0;       	}
