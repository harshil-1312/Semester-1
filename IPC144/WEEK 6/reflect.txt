1. Parallel arrays are used to stored data in a particular group where all the index of every array belongs to a specific data. Let’s get a brief idea form the example from my code.   do                {				    printf("   Does this item have financing options? [y/n]: ");				    scanf(" %c", &finance[a]);		            if ( (finance[a] != 'y') && (finance[a] != 'n') )            {            printf("      ERROR: Must be a lowercase 'y' or 'n'\n");            }               }while ( (finance[a] != 'y') && (finance[a] != 'n') );			In the above example I use finance as a array to store the input of financing option form the user in the code. so basically, what happens when user input the choice as I use finance with the index a (finance[a]) so whatever the choice input by the user is store in the index a and it can be use for the data that was/will store in the specific index ( [a] ). So character or number of index is a key from which developer can store any data in the specific index2. In array element always start form the 0 not from the 1 because each index holds an unique value so every time the value of index start with 0 and iterates up to 1 less than the given value that’s is why its very common to practice to iterate arrays with 0 not with 1. Lets take an example from my code.for(a=0; a<f; a++)    {                  printf("\nItem-%d Details:\n", (a + 1));                do        {                printf("   Item cost: $");		    scanf(" %lf", &price[a]);            if (price[a] < 100)                        {               printf("      ERROR: Cost must be at least $100.00\n");                 }	                } while (price[a] < 100);So here it iterates the array until it gets higher value than a so if user input 3 the it iterates the array for 0,1,2 because form 3 all values is higher.3. Let’s take the example of vending machine in vending machine each row is assign to specific drink so any other drink cannot be placed randomly so if there is a row of Pepsi than only Pepsi is placed in that and if there is row of Fanta then Fanta is only placed in that so basically this is the simple example of the array that it stores the data of a specific type only.
