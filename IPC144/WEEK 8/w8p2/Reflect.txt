1. Structural  data types demand more memory because in the structures we are calling the address or value  so if it contains more data than the copy of it also contain the more memory to store that data  that’s is the reason why structural data type contains more data. The bytes that “ReportData” contains 60 bytes. And for the efficient way to passing this information is by passing argument  by that we can store the address of the value instead of value so that can also take less memory and efficient way to pass the information.2. In the ReportData we have three same data that we already have in the CatFoodInfo by that we can also make a single structure and make use it in the function in that case we have to make some changes in the structure and we can efficiently use that in the code struct ReportData{		int gm;		double Sum_total;		double per_weight;		double per_cal;		double cost;		double kg;};struct CatFoodInfo{    int sku_num;     double value;     int cal;     double mass; };And the modified printfstatment is mention belowPrintf(cat.mass, report.mass);
