1. Using structures in workshop is very beneficial because when we use structure in the code we donÕt need to define different variables each time and by using structure its easy for the developer to code hundred and thousands of lines. Lets take the example from my code struct playerinfo{    char Character;    int lives;    int history[MAX_PATHLENGTH];    int treasure;};struct gameinfo{    int path_length;    int bombs[MAX_PATHLENGTH];    int treasure[MAX_PATHLENGTH];    int Moves;};Here I create structure for the player as well as the game so by that I donÕt need to create different variable each time and also this is the organise way to write any code and by this method of coding the precision level is much higher because if there is error we have to go through many variables in the whole code and that is very difficult to debug the code.2. If we have to enhanced this workshop and keep the history of the game then we have to make a logical loop in which the game iterates again and again and to store the value of each game result by making the structure of arrays and thatÕs how we can iterate the game and store the result each time.3. There are many section in this workshop that I find difficult to code but out of all the section I found more difficult is belowdo    {        if (nextMove > 0)        {            if (player.history[nextMove - 1] == 1)            {                printf("===============> Dope! You've been here before!\n");            }            else if (game.bombs[nextMove - 1] == 1 && game.treasure[nextMove - 1] == 1)            {                player.history[nextMove - 1] = 1;                player.lives--;                Treasure++;                game.Moves--;                printf("===============> [&] !!! BOOOOOM !!! [&]\n");                printf("===============> [&] $$$ Life Insurance Payout!!! [&]\n");            }            else if (game.bombs[nextMove - 1] == 1)            {                player.history[nextMove - 1] = 1;                player.lives--;                game.Moves--;                printf("===============> [!] !!! BOOOOOM !!! [!]\n");            }            else if (game.treasure[nextMove - 1] == 1)            {                player.history[nextMove - 1] = 1;                Treasure++;                game.Moves--;                printf("===============> [$] $$$ Found Treasure! $$$ [$]\n");            }            else            {                player.history[nextMove - 1] = 1;                game.Moves--;                printf("===============> [.] ...Nothing found here... [.]\n");            }            if (game.Moves == 0)            {                printf("\nNo more MOVES remaining!\n");            }            if (player.lives == 0)            {                printf("\nNo more LIVES remaining!\n");            }        if (nextMove > 0)        {            printf("\n  ");            for (p = 0; p < nextMove; p++)            {                if (p == (nextMove - 1))                {                    printf("%c", player.Character);                }                else                {                    printf(" ");                }            }        }So I apply many logics and do try and error for this particular part after spending some time finally I got the perfect logic that runs the code so this is the part where I face many difficulties.
